Revision history for Perl extension PostScript::File.

2.01   March 3, 2010
	- The metrics for the cp1252 encoding did not reflect the
	  accents mapped to control characters (but those characters
	  are not normally used, anyway).
	- Fixed some warnings in the test suite
	- Version 2.00 actually needs Encode 2.21, but only specified 2.12

2.00   February 26, 2010
	- Numerous API changes, mostly minor, but there could be
	  problems with backwards compatibility.

	- Changed ISOLatin1Encoding to match PostScript's
	  The HYPHEN-MINUS (\x2D) is now /minus instead of /hyphen.
	  Use SOFT-HYPHEN (\xAD) to get a proper hyphen.
	  Made the same change to Win1252Encoding (cp1252).

	  Please read Hyphens and Minus Signs in PostScript::File for details.

	- Added auto_hyphen attribute with get/set methods
	- Added need_fonts attribute
	- Added as_string, embed_font, need_resource, & testable_output methods
	- add_resource accepts all DSC 3.0 resource types,
	  but no longer accepts generic 'Resource' type
	- Reencode fonts added using embed_font or add_resource
	- Added PostScript::File::Metrics, which includes the metrics
	  for the standard PostScript fonts.  No more trying to
	  configure Font::AFM!!!
	- PNG output has been removed.  Use PostScript::Convert instead.
	- embed_document now handles & removes TIFF, WMF, or EPSI preview
	- output accepts an open filehandle as a filename alternative
	- Passing undef to output always returns the PostScript as a string

	Minor changes in 2.00:

	- Don't reencode Symbol; it doesn't use the StandardEncoding.
	  This is not backwards compatible, but I doubt anyone was
	  using Symbol-iso, as it's not very useful.
	- Mapped some control characters as accents in Win1252Encoding,
	  since the Red Book suggests they are required in langlevel 1
	- add_default, add_resource, add_setup, add_page_setup,
	  add_page_trailer, & add_trailer now append instead of
	  overwriting previous value
	- add_function is now a no-op if has_function returns true
	- add_resource uses BeginResource instead of deprecated comments
	- get_strip now returns 'none', 'space', or 'comments'
	  instead of the regular expression being used
	- In eps mode, output now returns a list of pages
	- Multiple calls to output no longer cause duplicate resources
	- Passing a filename to output does not permanently set the filename
	- Fonts & resources appear in the document Setup section
	  instead of the Prolog
	- Include a Local Variables section for Emacs in the %%Trailer
	  describing the file's encoding

1.05   October 29, 2009
	- Major change in the way reencode works
	  Setting it to 'cp1252' or 'iso-8859-1' causes automatic
	  character set translation from Unicode strings.
	- Added cp1252 (Win1252Encoding) support
	  Most people should now use reencode => 'cp1252',
	  even if they are not on Windows, to get the best
	  Unicode support (which is still quite limited).
	- When writing to a file, the output method now returns the pathname
	- The %%BoundingBox must be integers.  If it's not, round up and
	  also add a %%HiResBoundingBox comment.
	- Fixed bug in pstr (wasn't quoting backslashes)
	- It's %%PageOrder, not %%Order (and the order should be capitalized)
	- Added an examples directory

1.04   October 22, 2009
	- add_comment now appends to comments (as originally documented)
	  (fixes RT#25786)
	- Allow WIDTHxHEIGHT as a paper size
	- Remove spaces before DSC comments even when strip none
	- pstr now wraps strings longer than 240 characters
	- strip comments is more aggressive (but won't remove DSC comments)

1.03   October 20, 2009
	- Added pstr function/method
	- Added embed_document method
	- The dir & file parameters to new now actually work
	- The file_ext parameter and {get,set}_file_ext methods allow
	  you to change the way PostScript::File appends an extension
	  to the output filename
	- The PNG output added in 1.01 is now documented
	- Using Ghostscript to generate PNG should work on Windows now
	- Include resource types in %%DocumentSuppliedResources comment
	- Fixed has_function to avoid false positives
	- Include procset PostScript_File in %%DocumentSuppliedResources
	- PostScript::File now requires Perl 5.8.0 or later

1.02   September 21, 2009
	- Now maintained by Christopher J. Madsen
	- Stripping leading whitespace now works with Perl 5.10 (RT#49838)
