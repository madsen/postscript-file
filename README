convenient routines for writing postscript directly.  These include reporting
postscript errors and debugging support.  Here is the ubiquetous 'hello world'
program, written in PostScript using this module.

    use PostScript::File;
    my $ps = new PostScript::File( errors => "page",
				   debug => 2 );
    
    my ($x, $y) = (72, 300);
    my $message = "hello world";
    
    $ps->add_to_page( <<END_PAGE );
	/Helvetica findfont 
	12 scalefont 
	setfont
	$x $y moveto
	($message) show
    END_PAGE
    
    $ps->output( "~/hello" );
